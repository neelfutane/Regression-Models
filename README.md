# 📊 Regression Models – Life Expectancy Prediction

Welcome to the **Regression Models** project! This repository demonstrates the application of various regression techniques to predict life expectancy based on real-world data. The project walks through data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to gain insights into factors affecting life expectancy.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is related to life expectancy metrics from countries around the world. It includes features like:
- Adult Mortality
- Schooling
- GDP
- Immunization coverage
- BMI, and more.
